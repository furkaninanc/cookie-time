## About The Project

</p>

This project is designed to help people watch videos together, on virtual rooms.
<br />
<br />
It lets you join a room with your friends and add a video to the room (a direct video URL, or a YouTube video), and then it synchronizes your players so that you can enjoy the video at the same time.
